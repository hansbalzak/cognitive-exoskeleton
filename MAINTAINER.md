# Maintainer Statement

This project exists to support individual autonomy and local computation.

It is not intended to become a platform, startup, or enterprise product.

I reserve the right to reject contributions that move the project toward
centralization, commercialization, or extractive models.

Forks are welcome.
Capture is not.
