# Cognitive Exoskeleton

Cognitive Exoskeleton is an experimental local cognitive architecture focused on:

- self-correction  
- persistence  
- behavioral evolution  
- privacy-first operation  

This project emerged organically from building tools to externalize human reflection and learning.

It is not an AI agent.  
It is a cognitive exoskeleton.

This is not an enterprise framework.  
This is not a startup project.

## Development Process

This project was developed in collaboration with AI-assisted coding tools.

Portions of the codebase were generated or refined using large language models.
All generated output was reviewed, modified, and validated by the maintainer before inclusion.

This project is **not AI-autogenerated software** —  
it is intentionally **AI-assisted software** authored and curated by its maintainer.

## Project Principles

Cognitive Exoskeleton is built on principles of autonomy, transparency, and user sovereignty.

This software is intended to be:

- **Local-first:** designed to run entirely on user-controlled hardware.
- **Privacy-preserving:** no telemetry, no cloud dependency, no centralized data collection.
- **Commons-oriented:** contributions and improvements remain part of the public commons.
- **Non-extractive:** not built for commercial exploitation, hidden monetization, or proprietary lock-in.
- **Not an enterprise framework:** this is not intended as a corporate product, platform service, or hosted API.
- **Not SaaS-oriented:** if deployed as a hosted or network-accessible service, the complete corresponding source code must be provided under the same license (AGPLv3).

If your goals include enterprise adoption, proprietary extensions, closed-source commercialization,  
or building a paid platform on top of this work, this project’s philosophy and governance model  
likely do not align with those aims.
