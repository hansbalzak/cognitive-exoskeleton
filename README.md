## Project Principles

Cognitive Exoskeleton is built on principles of autonomy, transparency, and user sovereignty.

This software is intended to be:

- **Local-first:** designed to run entirely on user-controlled hardware.
- **Privacy-preserving:** no telemetry, no cloud dependency, no centralized data collection.
- **Commons-oriented:** contributions and improvements remain part of the public commons.
- **Non-extractive:** not built for commercial exploitation, hidden monetization, or proprietary lock-in.
- **Not an enterprise framework:** this is not intended as a corporate product, platform service, or hosted API.
- **Not SaaS-oriented:** if deployed as a hosted or network-accessible service, the complete corresponding source code must be provided under the same license (AGPLv3).

If your goals include enterprise adoption, proprietary extensions, closed-source commercialization, 
or building a paid platform on top of this work, this project’s philosophy and governance model 
likely do not align with those aims.


## Name and Trademark Policy

The name **Cognitive Exoskeleton** refers specifically to this open source project.

You are free to fork and modify the code under the terms of the AGPLv3.  
However, you may not use the name "Cognitive Exoskeleton", or imply endorsement by the original author,
for derivative works, commercial offerings, or hosted services without explicit permission.

Forks must adopt a distinct name to avoid confusion and preserve the identity of the original project.


## Contributing Ethos

Contributions are welcome from individuals who resonate with the goals of this project.

By contributing, you agree that your work remains licensed under the AGPLv3 
and becomes part of the shared commons.

This project intentionally does not prioritize:

- enterprise integrations
- cloud platforms
- proprietary tooling
- closed-source extensions
- commercial scalability

Contributions that introduce vendor lock-in, telemetry, centralized control,
or proprietary dependencies are unlikely to be accepted.
## Model Training Notice

The contents of this repository are not intended for training proprietary or closed-source models.

This project exists as part of the digital commons and is meant to support individual autonomy,
not large-scale extractive systems.
