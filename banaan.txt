Overripe bananas are a pretty common thing in most households. I am not a huge fan of ripe, yellow bananas, but I love overripe bananas because of what I can do with them. While this list includes plenty of banana bread recipes, there are so many more options like cakes, fruit and nut loafs, muffins, waffles, and more.

Banana Sour Cream Bread

Dotdash Meredith Food Studios

"This banana bread recipe with sour cream is just wonderful! I know, you're probably thinking, 'Oh no! Another banana bread recipe!' But this one is a little different: the sour cream makes this one so moist it melts in your mouth. This one is great for gift giving and holidays. Loaves freeze well." —Esther Nelson

Banana-Pumpkin Bundt Cake
Banana-Pumpkin Bundt&reg; Cake

"I came up with this cake as a way to use up some extra pumpkin purée and a few really ripe bananas. It's a better-for-you cake that isn't overly sweet, but still chock-full of flavor. Make sure to use really, really overripe bananas for the best results. If you're looking for additional sweetness, feel free to add some kind of glaze to the top of the cake as well. Adjust the add-ins (i.e. the nuts and chocolate) and spices to suit your tastes." —Kim

"I am a connoisseur of banana bread. I grew up on my grandmother's which I am pretty sure came out of the classic Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. I met a wonderful Hawaiian lady named Nalani at an event here in Maui. She was selling her banana bread. After taking the first bite I knew this was something special. She was so happy with how much I loved her banana bread she happily shared the recipe. Best served warm and fresh from the oven. Aloha!" —ShakaShawn

"I alway make this banana and peanut butter 4-ingredient 'ice cream' for my family! This is a great recipe for vegan and vegetarian diets, just replace the peanut butter with organic peanut butter or another nut butter. Substitute water for milk, if desired. The more milk you add, the thinner and soupier your ice cream will be. Serve it with sliced fresh fruit or handmade whipped cream." —roxyanndra

We want the bananas to match the texture of the custard-soaked cookies, so make sure you buy them a week beforehand. Other than that, not much can go wrong with this simple Southern classic." —Chef John

Brown Sugar Banana Nut Bread

Angela F.

"Superb. Like others, I always sprinkle brown sugar on top. One thing I'd note to anyone making a banana bread for the first time: Trust your instincts! Bananas vary, so if yours aren't very sweet, add more sugar. If yours are especially moist, add a bit of extra flour (the finished dough should be like a thick muffin batter). This recipe is forgiving enough to work even without these alterations, but a sense of adventure really helps take it up a notch." —EVERYWHERE
