# Governance

Cognitive Exoskeleton is maintained by its original author.

This project follows a maintainer-led governance model.

There is no foundation, steering committee, or corporate roadmap.
Final decisions regarding project direction, scope, and values rest with the maintainer.

The project intentionally prioritizes:

- individual autonomy
- local-first design
- commons-oriented development

over:

- enterprise adoption
- commercial scalability
- cloud platforms
- proprietary integrations

External contributions are welcome, but acceptance is based on alignment with these principles.
